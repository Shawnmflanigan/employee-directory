# Comprehensive Employee Directory Search

## Description

This application allows the user to sort and search all employees in a company by multiple criteria. In this example we search by first name and location (State), but the application can be easily adapted to sort and filter by whatever variable the user needs. It scales easily to include any number of employees and/or variables.
